# ChatScam


The repository contains 50,000 ChatGPT-related squatting domain names which is identified from a Passive DNS dataset. Based on this data, the cybersecurity community can thoroughly examine the impact of ChatGPT on the domain name abuse sector. 

The format of the data includes the domain name, ChatGPT-related keywords embedded within the domain, and the category of use for that domain. It is noteworthy that in this work, the categories mainly comprise four types: 1) websites offering chat function like ChatGPT; 2) underground industry websites, primarily involving pornography and gambling; 3) domain parking and sales websites; 4) other categories.
